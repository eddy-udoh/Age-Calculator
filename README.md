# Age Calculator

A simple and interactive **Age Calculator App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Enter your **date of birth**, and it instantly calculates your **exact age** in **years, months, and days**

This project was created as **Day 6** of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge** inspired by [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/c/GreatStack).
